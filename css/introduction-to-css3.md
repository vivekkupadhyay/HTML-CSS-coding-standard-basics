## Introduction to CSS3

`CSS3` is the latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language and aims at extending `CSS2.1`. 

- It brings a lot of long-awaited novelties, like **rounded corners**, **shadows**, **gradients**, **transitions** or **animations**, as well as new layouts like **multi-columns**, **flexible box** or **grid layouts**. 
- Experimental parts are vendor-prefixed and should either be avoided in production environments, or used with extreme caution as both their syntax and semantics can change in the future.


### Why should we use `CSS3` ?

- `CSS3` offers a huge variety of new ways to create an impact with your designs, with quite a few important changes.

- `CSS3` will obviously be completely backwards compatible, so it won’t be necessary to change existing designs to ensure they work – web browsers will always continue to support `CSS2`.

- The main impact will be the ability to use new **selectors** and **properties** which are available. These will allow you to both achieve new design features (`animation` or `gradients` for instance), and achieve current design features in a much easier way (e.g. using columns).
