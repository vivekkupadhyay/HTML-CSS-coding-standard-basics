## Conclusion  

`CSS` bring rich and powerful presentation techniques to the Web. Further, the ability to separate presentation rules into a separate file simplifies `HTML` authoring, and makes it easy to establish and maintain a consistent presentation even across the largest Web site. Here, we have shown only a few of the basic and commonly used capabilities available through style sheets. Other online resources, such as those listed in the `World Wide Web Consortium`'s Cascading Style Sheets page go into much greater detail.

Viewing this page in different browsers can also be an instructive experience. Different browsers treat CSS differently. Web page authors should familiarize themselves with the characteristics of the various browsers by viewing this and other pages in a variety of browsers, and by examining the Browser Compatibility Charts at webreview.com.
