## A simple HTML

Putting all together what we have learned so far, here is a tiny example of the  `HTML` **document**. 

- You can copy this `code` to a **text editor**, save it as `myFirstCode.html`, and load it in a browser. 
- Make sure you are saving it using the `character encoding UTF-8`. 
- Since this document uses **no styling** it will look very plain, but it's just a small start.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>A HTML document</title>
	</head>
	<body>
  		<h1>Main heading in my document</h1>
  		<p>The HTML specification defines a single language that can be written either with the relaxed HTML syntax or the stricter XML syntax (Extensible Markup Language). HTML also addresses the needs of Web apps. HTML only describes the meaning of the content, not style and formatting. To define appearance and layout, please use CSS, not explicit presentational HTML.</p>
	</body>
</html>
```
