## Conclusion

The new semantic elements introduced in `HTML5` bring the ability to describe the structure and the outline of a *web document* in a standard way. They bring a big advantage for people having `HTML5` browsers and needing the structure to help them understand the page, for instance people needing the help of some assistive technology. These new semantic elements are simple to use and, with very few burdens, can be made to work also in non-HTML5 browsers. Therefore they should be used without restrictions.
