## Introdcution to HTML5

`HTML5` is the latest evolution of the standard that defines `HTML`. `HTML5` is the fifth revision and newest version of the `HTML` standard. It offers new features that provide not only **rich media support**, but also enhance support for creating web applications that can interact with the user, his/her local data, and servers, more easily and effectively than was possible previously.
 
The term represents two different concepts:

1. It is a new version of the language `HTML`, with new **elements**, **attributes**, and **behaviors**.
2. It is a larger set of technologies that allows more diverse and powerful Web sites and applications. This set is sometimes called HTML5 & friends and often shortened to just HTML5.

Designed to be usable by all Open Web developers, this reference page links to numerous resources about `HTML5` technologies, classified into several groups based on their function.
