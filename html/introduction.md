Practically when we look at a *webpage* in a *web-browser*, we see texts, images and sometimes media elemnts(video/audio) too.
These texts can be of diffrent `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight` and `color` and so as the media elements. It can ask you some information via
a simple `form` it has, or can also help you to customize the view of the *webpage* for a better *user-experience*.

A typical *webpage* depends on several technologies (such as `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `Flash`, `AJAX`, `JSON`) to control what the end-user sees, 
but most fundamentally, developers write *webpages* in [**`HTML`**](http://www.w3.org/html), without which there can be no *webpages*. 
To display the page on the client-side device, a browser starts out by reading the [**`HTML`**](http://www.w3.org/html).

Now the question is: 
### What is HTML?

[**`HTML`**](http://www.w3.org/html) is a markup language. The word markup was used by editors who marked up
manuscripts (usually with a blue pencil) when giving instructions for revisions. **Markup** now means something slightly 
different: a language with specific syntax that instructs a Web browser how to display a page. [**`HTML`**](http://www.w3.org/html)
separates **content** (words, images, audio, video, and so on) from **presentation** (instructions for displaying each type of content).
